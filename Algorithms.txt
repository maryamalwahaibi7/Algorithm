What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a simple way to write the steps of an algorithm using plain English.
It shows the logic of a solution without using real programming syntax and helps plan before coding.

Why and when we use it?

Why we use pseudocode:

To understand and plan the logic of a solution
To focus on thinking, not programming syntax
To explain algorithms clearly

When we use it:

Before writing actual code
When designing or learning an algorithm
When explaining a solution to others

How to write pseudocode to represent an algorithm

Write the steps in simple, clear English
Start with START and end with END
Write steps in logical order
Use common words like INPUT, OUTPUT, IF, ELSE, WHILE, FOR
Avoid programming syntax (no semicolons or brackets)

Example of a problem and its algorithm written in pseudocode

Problem: Find the sum of two numbers.
START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
sum ← number1 + number2
OUTPUT sum
END

Task 1: Calculate Average
START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
Sum = number1 + number2
Count number of values
Average = Sum of numbers ÷ Number of values
return average
END

Task 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
START
INPUT number
Divide the number by 2
Check the remainder
If the remainder is 0
OUTPUT "Even"
If the remainder is not 0
OUTPUT "Odd"
return OUTPUT
END

Task 3: Find the Smallest Number in a List
START
INPUT list of numbers
Set smallest to first number in the list
Check each number in the list
If the number is smaller than smallest
Update smallest
return smallest
END

Task 4: Count Positive and Negative Numbers
START
INPUT list of numbers
Add two counters
one for positive numbers
one for negative numbers
Check each number in the list
If the number is greater than 0, increase the positive counter
If the number is less than 0, increase the negative counter
RETURN positive Count, negative Count
END

Task 5: Remove Duplicates from a List
START
INPUT list of numbers
Add new empty list to store unique values
Check each element in the list
If element is unique , add it the new list 
If element is not unique , don't add it the new list 
return result
END

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that can be divided only by 1 and themselves—no other whole numbers.
Examples:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11
Task 6: Find All Prime Numbers Up to N
START
INPUT a positive number N
Create an empty list to store prime numbers
Start checking numbers from 2 up to N
For each number, check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself
If it can be divided, it is not prime
If it cannot be divided by any number, it is a prime number
Store the prime numbers in a list
return result
END
