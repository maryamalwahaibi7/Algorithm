What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a simple way to write the steps of an algorithm using plain English.
It shows the logic of a solution without using real programming syntax and helps plan before coding.

Why and when we use it?

Why we use pseudocode:

To understand and plan the logic of a solution
To focus on thinking, not programming syntax
To explain algorithms clearly

When we use it:

Before writing actual code
When designing or learning an algorithm
When explaining a solution to others

How to write pseudocode to represent an algorithm

Write the steps in simple, clear English
Start with START and end with END
Write steps in logical order
Use common words like INPUT, OUTPUT, IF, ELSE, WHILE, FOR
Avoid programming syntax (no semicolons or brackets)

Example of a problem and its algorithm written in pseudocode

Problem: Find the sum of two numbers.
START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
sum ← number1 + number2
OUTPUT sum
END

Task 1: Calculate Average
START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
Sum = number1 + number2
Average = Sum of numbers ÷ 2
return average
END

Task 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
START
INPUT number
Divide the number by 2
Check the remainder
If the remainder is 0
OUTPUT "Even"
If the remainder is not 0
OUTPUT "Odd"
return OUTPUT
END

Task 3: Find the Smallest Number in a List
START
INPUT list of numbers
Set smallest to first number in the list
Check each number in the list
If the number is smaller than smallest
Update smallest
return smallest
END

Task 4: Count Positive and Negative Numbers
START
INPUT list of numbers
Add two counters
one for positive numbers
one for negative numbers
Check each number in the list
If the number is greater than 0, increase the positive counter
If the number is less than 0, increase the negative counter
RETURN positive Count, negative Count
END

Task 5: Remove Duplicates from a List
START
INPUT list of numbers
Add new empty list to store unique values
Check each element in the list
If element is unique , add it the new list 
If element is not unique , don't add it the new list 
return result
END

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that can be divided only by 1 and themselves—no other whole numbers.
Examples:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11
Task 6: Find All Prime Numbers Up to N
START
INPUT a positive number N
Create an empty list to store prime numbers
Start checking numbers from 2 up to N
For each number, check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself
If it can be divided, it is not prime
If it cannot be divided by any number, it is a prime number
Store the prime numbers in a list
return result
END

Task 7: Merge Two Sorted Lists
START
INPUT sorted list 1
INPUT sorted list 2
Create a new empty list to store the merged result
Compare the first elements of both lists
Add the smaller element to the new list
return result
END

Task 8: Find the Second Largest Number
START
INPUT list of numbers
Set the first number as the largest
Set another value to store the second largest
Check each number in the list one by one
If a number is greater than the largest, update both largest and second largest
If a number is smaller than the largest but greater than the second largest, update the second largest
return result
END

A palindrome is a word, number, or phrase that reads the same forward and backward.
Examples:
Word: madam
Number: 121
Phrase: level

Task 9: Check if a String is a Palindrome
Take a string as input
Convert the string to the same case (for example, all lowercase)
Remove all spaces from the string
Set one position at the beginning of the string
Set another position at the end of the string
Compare the characters at both positions
If any characters are different, it is not a palindrome
If all characters match, it is a palindrome
return result
END

The Fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it.
Example:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Task 10: Generate Fibonacci Sequence
START
Take a positive number N
Create a list to store the Fibonacci numbers
Add 0 as the first number
Add 1 as the second number
For the remaining numbers: add the last two numbers to get the next number
Store each new number in the list
Repeat until N numbers are generated
return result
END
