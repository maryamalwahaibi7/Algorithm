What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a simple way to write the steps of an algorithm using plain English.
It shows the logic of a solution without using real programming syntax and helps plan before coding.

Why and when we use it?

Why we use pseudocode:

To understand and plan the logic of a solution
To focus on thinking, not programming syntax
To explain algorithms clearly

When we use it:

Before writing actual code
When designing or learning an algorithm
When explaining a solution to others

How to write pseudocode to represent an algorithm

Write the steps in simple, clear English
Start with START and end with END
Write steps in logical order
Use common words like INPUT, OUTPUT, IF, ELSE, WHILE, FOR
Avoid programming syntax (no semicolons or brackets)

Example of a problem and its algorithm written in pseudocode

Problem: Find the sum of two numbers.
START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
sum ← number1 + number2
OUTPUT sum
END

Task 1: Calculate Average
START
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
Sum = number1 + number2
Count number of values
Average = Sum of numbers ÷ Number of values
return average
END
